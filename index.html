                <h3>Technology Is Quickly Outgrowing Humans</h3>

                <p>It is becoming a concerning factor that technology is quickly outgrowing humans at a rapid pace. For one, artificial intelligence is advancing
                   at a speed like no other. It can process and solve algorithms at speeds faster than any human capability. For example, ChatGPT 4.0 can score
                   at least 80% on the bar exam with just one command. Technology has also improved efficiency in food industries by using machines and robots
                   to perform tasks with more precision. A self-serving robot that works as a waiter/waitress in a restaurant is a great example of this.
                   Delivering food to patrons' tables with consistency shows how technology has grown.
                   There are cars now that are fully electric and self-drivable. Using only our devices, we are able to drive these cars and automatically update
                   software throughout the vehicle. Seeing that technology clearly plays a massive role in today's future, it is important that humans
                   do not become any less than technology itself. While humans may have their limits, technology is not limited to any physical
                   restraints which allows it to increase productivity.

                <h3>Protect Your Network!</h3>

                <p>
                    Protecting your network is important when you have any kind of sensitive information which may include digital assets. However, there are
                    at least 5 steps we can take in order to prevent any loss and to protect your network. Creating a strong and unique password for all
                    devices and accounts can ensure your network is safe. It is also a good idea to avoid reusing passwords. Using a Two-Factor Authentication
                    tool is also a good idea. By adding a second form of verification such as a cellphone number, users can have a code sent to their devices
                    for verification. Installing regular updates keeps your applications up to date with the latest software and security enhancements. These
                    regular updates usually include the latest patches and bug fixes. Furthermore, by installing Firewalls, you are able to monitor and control
                    network traffic. Firewalls give you the power to block and prevent any unauthorized access. Performing a regular backup helps secure critical
                    data as well. This helps when you suffer a loss of important data during a system failure. By following these steps, you can significantly
                    increase the security of your network and reduce any factors of unauthorized access.
